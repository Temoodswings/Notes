# Euler’s Number

written by Alfred.

## What is e

During the class on Tuesday, we talk about e, Euler’s number which is approximately equal to 2.71828.
 To be more specifically, 
 $${\displaystyle e = \lim_{x \to \infty} (1+\frac{1}{n})^{n} 
= \sum_{n =1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{n!}}$$

## The investigation during class

Our teacher introduced the concept of e by asking us to investigate continuous compound interest. I found that as n become very large, the value of  $(1+\frac{1}{n})^n$ barely changes. Later, I learn that the very value approaches  e = 2.71828…, an irrational number. 

## Extended information about e and its usage

After reading some materials online, I discovered that e has a great number of applications.

### Compound interest

e essential when computing the total maximum accumulated value. (mentioned in class)
The formula of the compound interest is $A = P \times (1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$  .

- A is the final amount, P is the original principal sum, r is the nominal annual interest rate, n is the compounding frequency, t is the overall length of time the interest is applied.

### Derangement

e can be used to work out the derangements, which is a permutation of the elements of a set and there are no element in the set that appears in its original position.
The formulas are:

$$
!n = n!\sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{i!}  = \left \lfloor \frac{n!}{e}+\frac{1}{2}\right \rfloor\ {\rm for} \ n \ge 1
$$

### Complex numbers

Euler’s formula: $e^{i \theta} = cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta)$, sometimes it is written as $cis(\theta)$.

Special case: when $\theta$ = $\pi$, $e^{i\pi} = -1$.(Euler’s Identity)

### In calculus

e have important properties.Such as the exponential function is the unique nontrivial function that is its own derivative.

$$
{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}e^{x}=e^{x}}
$$

It is also crucial when dealing with the derivative of base-a logarithms.

$$
\begin{aligned}\frac{d}{d x} \log _{a} x &=\lim _{h \to 0} \frac{\log _{a}(x+h)-\log _{a}(x)}{h} \\&=\lim _{h \to 0} \frac{\log _{a}(1+\frac{h}{x})}{x \cdot \frac{h}{x} } \\&=\frac{1}{x} \log _{a}\left(\lim _{u \rightarrow 0}(1+u)^{\frac{1}{u}}\right) \\&=\frac{1}{x} \log _{a} e\end{aligned}
$$

## Reflection

Investigation after class can really broaden one’s horizon. It’s truly a intriguing process in which enrich my knowledge that I may never or haven’t learned in class. I’ll probably do more research not only in e but also other math concepts later on.
